# How it works

Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry offers an effective solution for handling masked or obscured areas in imagery
through its multi-image processing capabilities. As illustrated in the diagram, when two overlapping images contain
masks identifying problematic areas (such as glints or data gaps), SfM can leverage the complementary information from
both images during the alignment and mosaicking process.

**Key Requirements for Optimal Results:**

- Image overlap >50% recommended
- Consistent lighting conditions
- Proper camera settings
- Quality source imagery
