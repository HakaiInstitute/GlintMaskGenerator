# Glint Mask Generator

Glint Mask Generator is a simple utility for generating mask images from some source imagery. These masks correspond to
areas of glint and can used by structure-from-motion (SfM) software to replace non-useful glint areas with data from
overlapping imagery that are not glinty.
